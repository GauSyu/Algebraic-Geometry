# Algebraic-Geometry
This repository is used to put my notes on algebraic geometry. It's based on my hand-written notes for Prof. Fu's lectures in Chern Institute, my reading notes for Stack Project and so on. The process of texify my notes will cost lots of time and I will keep updating the files. If you find any mistakes, please leave your comment.
